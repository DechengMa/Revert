<p>A scenario demonstrating the following Broken Constraints attributes:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>The green scroll view has missing scrollable content width.</li>
  <li>The blue scroll view has missing scrollable content height.</li>
  <li>The orange view bar has missing constraints for horizontal position.</li>
  <li>The green view bar has missing constraints for height and vertical position.</li>
  <li>The purple view bar has missing constraints for vertical position.</li>
  <li>The yellow view bar has missing constraints for width and horizontal position.</li
  <li>The blue view in the center does not have any constraint issues until a user clicks on the buttton below to break its constraint. Clicking on the button will change the value of the blue view&#39;s width to zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>This view includes missing constraints for width, height, horizontal position, vertical position, scrollable content width and scrollable content height. Inspect the issues in <em>Reveal</em> and on your device or simulator.</p>
